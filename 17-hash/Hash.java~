/*
hashing/hash tables
    you want to store data in a table (array) by some unique ID.

a hash function is a mappijng that takes an id and converts it into a table
index.
ex: id is osis #
  hcdx)= x%10000
       better might be:
        h(x) = (product of all nonzero digits in x) % 10000
       	                                            ^always end
       	                                            w/% tablesize
when multiple IDs hash to the same table index we have a collision or clash
--> your hash table must be large enough so that it is sparsely populated
