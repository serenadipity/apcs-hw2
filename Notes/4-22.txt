Definitions:

graphs --> a collection of nodes and edges
(vertex)node --> holds stuff
edge --> connects stuff

Cyclic Graph --> can get back to node w/o retracing steps)
Acyclic Graph --> (can't get back to node w/o retracing steps)

Directed Graph --> waiting for next step

DAG --> Directed Acyclic Graph

Trees --> empty or an acyclic graph with one node designated as the root
root --> starting point
child(and parent)--> connected to end 1 level down from its parent node
leaf --> a node with 0 children
path --> the sequence of nodes and of edges connecting 2 nodes
ancestors --> any nodes on the path from you up to the root
descendants --> any nodes on your subtrees
siblings --> children of the same parent
height --> the length of the longest path to the root
fullness --> full tree has the maximum number of nodes
balance --> 

binary tree --> each node has 0, 1, or 2 children
